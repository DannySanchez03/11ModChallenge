# Note-Taker

10th Challenge

Deployed: [here](https://my-note-taker-app-hehe-c865ff4718a5.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

In this 10th Challenge I was given starter code for html, css, and the index.js, I had to hook this up to the backend, which envovled using and creating server.js, and installing express from the npm. I had to upload this to a heroku server. This app can save notes and remove notes from its live server, server does restart and gets rid of all messages except the one that is always created when the DB is crated again.
